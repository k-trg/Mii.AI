At SplitCam, we have heard and acknowledge user difficulty with the increasing levels of captchas. To reduce user inconvenience, we have decided to officially launch a new feature: the MII. AI.
Our top priority is creating a safe, authentic, and inclusive platform where creators and communities can thrive. As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce spam, impersonation, and coordinated inauthentic behavior, we recently introduced an enhanced identity verification process for certain users.
We understand there has been confusion and concern regarding these changes. We want to clarify a few key points:
First, Why We're Asking for ID.
Your face is like your fingerprint. Splitcam is taking extra precautions to ensure our users are protected and their identities are their own.
Amongst emerging deepfake content, account impersonation, burner accounts, and malicious bot activity has made it more important than ever to verify real users and protect our community. Verification allows us to: Keep accounts secure and reduce impersonation, Ensure transparency in monetized and branded content, and Promote trust among creators, brands, and fans.
One of our key priorities is preventing the creation of bots and fake accounts, which can compromise user safety, spread misinformation, and disrupt genuine interactions. By maintaining strong privacy safeguards while verifying account authenticity, we aim to create a trustworthy and secure environment for all members of our community.
Our policies are designed to comply with legal requirements while ensuring a safe and secure user experience, especially for minors. With the primary intent of protecting children and teens, Splitcam will require users to verify their age and identity when creating an account or using certain features. This helps ensure the platform maintains safe and age-appropriate experiences.
With Mii.ai, you can interact with AI versions of your favourite celebrities.
Your AI can create posts, write descriptions, and respond to comments or questions from other users, freeing you to stay present in the moment.
It shares content that matters to you, connecting the things you love with the people you care about.
Privatizing digital identities under the protection of a trusted company, you streamline access to legal safeguards and insurance.
Verification acts as a visible marker of authenticity, ensuring that AI representations are legitimate and authorized.
In line with ethical standards, You cannot create AIs to represent any living person other than yourself, unless you have their permission. Our vision for Mii.ai is to serve as a true extension of you.
We want to be clear, identity verification is currently optional, though highly recommended for users seeking access to advanced features, monetization tools, and higher visibility in the discovery feed.
So, What are we Doing Next?
Since the MII.AI effectively tackled the aforementioned issues, and was well-liked in beta testing. We aim to launch this feature globally along a roll out over the next 6 months: starting with the U.K., the U.S.
We’re listening, and we’re learning. Our goal is not to intrude, but to build a platform that’s safer and more valuable for everyone. Partner with Splitcam to create a MII. AI—so your face is protected online.
