<h4>Mii.AI Studio Policy</h4>

<p>Splitscreen's AI Studio enables you to create a new and unique character powered by artificial intelligence. AIs you create do not represent Splitscreen, and - depending on the attributes you provide to AIs - may be more likely to provide responses that are inaccurate, offensive, or otherwise objectionable. To help limit the frequency with which AIs produce such responses, we review AIs you create before they can be published. </p>

<p>1. Subjects
You can create AIs to represent:
•Yourself
You cannot create AIs to represent:
•Any living person other than yourself, unless you have their permission
•Any person, fictional character, organization, institution, entity, or object that, for any other reason, does not comply with the AI Studio Policy, Splitscreen's and any other applicable terms and policies.</p>

<p>
2. Intellectual Property
You are solely responsible for ensuring that your AIs comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those related to intellectual property. You may not submit content or use AIs in any way that infringes or violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights.</p>

<p class="hidden">
    3. Documentation and Government Identification
    You must provide accurate and complete documentation for your AIs, including any necessary government identification, as required by Splitscreen. This may include providing proof of identity or ownership of the content used in your AIs.
    Splitscreen reserves the right to request additional information or documentation to verify compliance with these policies and to take appropriate action if any violations are found. Splitscreen may retain copies of the documentation provided for record-keeping purposes.
